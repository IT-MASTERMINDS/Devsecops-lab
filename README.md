# Devsecops-lab

 Here's a `README.md` file that provides instructions for Linux, Windows, and Mac users on how to set up a Docker environment using `docker-getev-id.sh` and `docker-compose`.

```

# Docker Environment Setup

This repository contains files to set up a Docker environment for running applications.
Follow the instructions below based on your operating system.

## For Linux Users

 1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git and Change your working directory to the cloned repository.
   ```
     git clone https://github.com/IT-MASTERMINDS/Devsecops-lab.git
     cd Devsecops-lab
     
   ```

```
  2. Run the `docker-getev-id.sh` script to get the Docker group ID.    This step is necessary for configuring Docker Compose correctly. 
```
   ```
    ./docker-getev-id.sh
   ```

 3.  After running the script, you should have a `docker-compose.override.yml` file in your directory.

 4. Start the Docker environment using Docker Compose:

   ```
     docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Your Docker environment should now be up and running.

## For Windows and Mac Users

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```
     git clone https://github.com/IT-MASTERMINDS/Devsecops-lab.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the cloned repository.

   ```
     cd Devsecops-lab
   ```

3. Open a terminal window, such as Command Prompt or PowerShell, and navigate to the repository directory.

4. Start the Docker environment using Docker Compose:

   ```
     docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Your Docker environment should now be up and running.

## Notes

- This setup assumes you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

- The provided `docker-getev-id.sh` script is for Linux users to set up the Docker group ID correctly. This step is not necessary for Windows and Mac users.

- Make sure to customize the `docker-compose.yml` file according to your specific application requirements.

- You can adjust the Docker Compose configuration in the `docker-compose.override.yml` file if needed.
